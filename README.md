## Presentations

- [UNC, November 2021](unc-202111.html) I presented preliminary results as a seminar at UNC, Chapel Hill. What a great place! Big thanks to [Qing Gong](https://econ.unc.edu/directory/qinggong/) for the invitation.

- [IU, February 2022](iu-202202.html) I presented some marginally less preliminary results as a seminar at IU, Bloomington. Always great to make it back to Bloomington! Thank you to the incredible [Kosali Simon](https://oneill.indiana.edu/faculty-research/directory/profiles/faculty/full-time/simon-kosali.html) for the invitation.
