- [UNC, November 2021](https://raw.githack.com/imccart/referrals-and-learning/main/presentations/unc-202111.html). I presented preliminary results as a seminar at UNC, Chapel Hill. What a great place! Big thanks to [Qing Gong](https://econ.unc.edu/directory/qinggong/) for the invitation.

- [IU, February 2022](https://raw.githack.com/imccart/referrals-and-learning/main/presentations/iu-202202.html). I presented some marginally less preliminary results as a seminar at IU, Bloomington.
