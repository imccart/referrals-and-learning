# Why physician referrals?

## Physician Referrals

Service market where professionals with general skills (e.g., primary care) direct consumers to professionals with specialized skills

1. Substantial heterogeneity in prices and quality across specialists
2. Prices do not clear market in the short run

---

Uncertainty about quality is a defining characteristic of most health care markets:

> Uncertainty as to the quality of the product is perhaps more intense here than in any other important commodity.

-- Arrow 1963, p. 951

## Background on Referrals


- \$2 trillion in physician services $+$ hospital care in 2019
- Primary care accounts for only 5% -- 8%

## Our Approach

- Physician practice styles / supply-side factors are a large source of inefficient variations in health care
- Develop a structural learning model for referral decisions and apply it to a specific area of health care with a well defined network of referring physicians and specialists

---

## {visibility="uncounted"}

### Model also accounts for:

- Habit persistence (i.e., preference to refer to familiar specialists)
- Congestion / capacity constraints at specialists

---

## {visibility="uncounted"}

### Model allows us to quantify:

- How quickly do referring physicians learn about specialist quality?
- How much does quality affect referrals, compared to other factors?
- What is the scope to improve patient allocations, via better learning or information dissemination?

## Preliminary Results

- Descriptively, wide variation in specialists' outcomes, *within each geographic market*, suggests possible gains from reallocating patients

::: {.bullet-text}
e.g., average difference btw 75th pctile (bad) and 25 pctile (good) specialist in each market:

- rehospitalization rate: 0.046 (+63\% relative)
- spending per patient: \$7,900 (+46\% relative)

- Descriptively, wide variation in specialists' outcomes, *within each geographic market*, suggests possible gains from reallocating patients
- Design-based evidence in event study framework

::: {.bullet-text}
- 0.07 fewer referrals per quarter after bad outcome
- 37% reduction on a mean of 0.187 referrals per quarter among treated pairs
- Applies to PCP-specialist pairs with prior experience, at least one bad outcome, and specialists who receive referrals from multiple PCPs

- Multinomial logits with specialist fixed effects, estimated separately in each geographic market

::: {.bullet-text}
  - One additional bad outcome reduces relative referral probability by 3.4\% on average

## Learning about Quality

- Bayesian learning, multi-armed bandit framework

::: {.bullet-text}
  - Beta-binomial model, as proposed in the literature to study physician learning and treatment variations (Phelps and Mooney 1992)

## Learning about Quality {visibility="uncounted"}

$$a_{ijt} = a_0 + \sum_{s=1}^t Y_{ijs} , \ \ b_{ijt} = b_0 + \sum_{s=1}^t (D_{ijs} - Y_{ijs})$$

## Referring Physician's Utility

- PCP $i$ utility from sending patient $t$ to specialist $j$ (at date $t$): 

$$U_{ijt} \equiv \alpha Y_{ijt} + f(e_{ijt}) + c(n_{jt}, z_j) + u(x_{ijt}) + \xi_j + \epsilon_{ijt}$$

---

## Referring Physician's Utility {visibility="uncounted"}

$$U_{ijt} \equiv \alpha Y_{ijt} + f(e_{ijt}) + c(n_{jt}, z_j) + u(x_{ijt}) + \xi_j + \epsilon_{ijt}$$

::: {.bullet-text}
$\alpha$ -- weight on patient outcomes (e.g., altruism) <br>
$f$ -- subjective taste for familiarity <br>
$x$ -- patient-specific factors (e.g., distance) <br>
$c$ -- congestion effect (specialists have limited supply) <br>
$z$ -- factors affecting capacity (e.g., max operating days per month) <br>
$\xi$ -- other demand factors (unobserved to econometrician) <br>
$\epsilon$ -- idiosyncratic shock

## Myopic PCPs

$$\max_{j \in J} \ \text{E} \left[ U_{ijt} | \dots \right] = \max_{j \in J} \text{ } \alpha m_{ijt} + f(e_{ijt}) + c(n_{jt}, z_j) + u(x_{ijt}) + \xi_j + \epsilon_{ijt}$$

Use mean belief at start of period $t$:

$$m_{ijt} \equiv E \left[q_j | (D_{ijs}, Y_{ijs})_{s=1}^{t-1} \right] = \frac{ a_{ij,t-1} }{ a_{ij,t-1} + b_{ij,t-1} } = \frac{ a_0 +  \sum_{s=1}^{t-1} Y_{ijs} }{ a_0 + b_0 + \sum_{s=1}^{t-1} D_{ijs} }$$

- Gittins index is a known transformation of $m$ and $v$
- Hence, $\alpha g(m,v)$ is a function of the same unknown parameters ($\alpha, a_0, b_0$) and observables ($e, \bar y$) as the analogous term ($\alpha m$) in the myopic model

## Counterfactuals

::: {.incremental}
- *Faster learning:* reduce strength of priors: e.g., $(a_0, b_0) \rightarrow  (a_0 / 2, b_0 / 2)$
- *Complete information:* replace $g(m_{ijt}, v_{ijt})$ with $g(q_j, 0)$ (measures losses due to uncertainty about quality)
- *Forced (or incentivized) experimentation:* assign some fraction of patients to exogenously selected specialists

## Distribution of Logit Coefficient Estimates {visibility="uncounted"}

- With national average coef's, the marginal effect of failure rate is negative if at least 22.4\% of past patients have been sent to a specialist
- Negative interaction term is consistent with the learning model (e.g., effect of failure rate in myopic model):

$$\alpha m_{ijt} = \alpha \frac{ a_0 }{ (a_0 + b_0) + e_{ijt} } + \alpha \frac{ e_{ijt} }{ (a_0 + b_0) + e_{ijt} } \times \bar y_{ijt}$$

Interpretation:

- 4.445 referrals per pair (over six years)
- 1 failure / 4.445 = 0.225 increase in failure rate
- 0.33 average share of referrals sent to most chosen specialist
- 0.225 x 0.0502 / 0.33 = 3.4\% relative reduction

## Summary

- Substantial improvements would be possible if referrals can be reallocated *within* geographic areas
- Structural learning model can quantify losses due to uncertainty and project gains from possible reallocation
- Design-based evidence of learning: PCPs respond to negative outcomes by reducing referrals to specialists
- Structural model is identified, but more work to understand role of priors and familiarity

## Congestion Effect {#sec-appendix-a visibility="uncounted"}

:::{.bullet-text-title}
From Richards-Shubik, Roberts, and Donohue 2022<br>
Return to [Myopic Slides](#sec-id-myopic)
:::

- Based on Bayer and Timmins (2007) spatial equilibrium model: spillovers among consumers who choose the same "location"
- Approach is similar to BLP demand estimation, but congestion effect takes the place of a price

## Congestion Effect {visibility="uncounted"}

:::{.bullet-text-title}
From Richards-Shubik, Roberts, and Donohue 2022<br>
Return to [Myopic Slides](#sec-id-myopic)
:::

- Estimate multinomial logit with specialist-time fixed effects ($\delta_{jt}$) $$\alpha m_{ijt} + f(e_{ijt}) + u(x_{ijt}) + \underbrace{ c(n_{jt}, z_j) + \xi_j }_{\delta_{jt}} + \epsilon_{ijt}$$
- Recover congestion effect using regression of estimated fixed effects: $$\hat \delta_{jt} = c(n_{jt}, z_j) + \xi_j + \eta_{jt}$$

::: {.bullet-text}
  - instrument for $n_{jt}$ is distances from *other* patients to specialist $j$
  - e.g., 2SLS estimation if $c$ is linear

## Identification of the myopic model {#sec-appendix-b visibility="uncounted"}

:::{.bullet-text-title}
Return to [Myopic Slides](#sec-id-myopic)
:::


$$\alpha m_{ijt} + f(e_{ijt}) + c(n_{jt}, z_j) + u(x_{ijt}) + \xi_j + \epsilon_{ijt}$$

- Strength of priors ($a_0 + b_0$): how the marginal effect of the success rate changes with experience (i.e., interaction)
$$\alpha m_{ijt} = \alpha \frac{ a_0 }{ (a_0 + b_0) + e_{ijt} } + \alpha \frac{ e_{ijt} }{ (a_0 + b_0) + e_{ijt} } \times \bar y_{ijt}$$
