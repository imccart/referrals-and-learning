\begin{itemize}

    \item Descriptively, the wide variation in specialists' outcomes, \emph{within each geographic market}, suggests possible gains:
    % If a patient could be reallocated...
    \bit
        \item[] e.g., average difference btw 75th pctile (bad) and 25 pctile (good) specialist in each market:
        \item[-] rehospitalization rate: 0.046 (+63\% relative)
        % 75th pctile = 1.63 $\times$ 25th pctile \ (4.6\% diff.)
        \item[-] spending per patient: \$7,900 (+46\% relative)
        % 75th pctile = 1.45 $\times$ 25th pctile \ (\$7,900)
        % a bad specialist has 1.63x higher failure rate than a good specialist
        % a high cost specialist has 1.45x more medicare expenses per episode than a low cost specialist
    \eit
    \bigskip
    
    \item Multinomial logits with specialist fixed effects, estimated separately in each geographic market
    \bit
        \item One additional bad outcome reduces referral probability by 3.4\% (relative), on average nationwide
        \item Consistent with the learning model, response to bad outcomes is stronger when PCP has more experience with a specialist

\begin{frame}{Related literature}
\begin{itemize}

\item Structural learning models have been widely applied to study product choice and related problems (Ching, Erdem, and Keane 2013)

\item Many studies in economics and marketing have applied Bayesian learning models to prescribing decisions by individual physicians
% Focusing on examples in economics that use forward-looking models:

    \item New pharmaceutical drugs \\

\item Other factors affecting referral choice:
% Not in the model I am presenting today, but could potentially be incorporated.
\bit
    \item peers from medical training
    \item distance between offices
    \item specialist gender, homophily

Independence in this context implies that the probability of a successful outcome from treatment j is independent of the probability of success on treatment k."

He calculates for each arm an index that only depends on the arm’s current state and calibrates the value of pulling it until some optimal stopping time. The Gittins index policy simply selects the arm with the highest index in each period. Gittins then shows the index policy is optimal in the standard MAB framework, which requires four assumptions: (a) exactly one arm is chosen (or active) in each period; (b) the unchosen arms do not generate rewards; (c) states of the unchosen arms remain frozen, generating the same average rewards in later periods; and (d) the arms are independent."

\begin{itemize}

\item Altruism parameter ($\alpha$): marginal effect of success rate, in limit as $e \rightarrow \infty$ (``identification at infinity'')
\[
\alpha m_{ijt} 
= \alpha \frac{ a_0 +  \sum_{s=1}^{t-1} Y_{ijs} }{ a_0 + b_0 + \sum_{s=1}^{t-1} D_{ijs} }
= \alpha \frac{ a_0/e_{ijt} + \bar y_{ijt} }{ (a_0 + b_0)/e_{ijt} + 1 } 
\]
where $\bar y_{ijt} \equiv \sum_{s=1}^{t-1} Y_{ijs} / \sum_{s=1}^{t-1} D_{ijs}$
and $e_{ijt} \equiv \sum_{s=1}^{t-1} D_{ijs}$
\vskip3pt
% Thus cases where a PCP has large past experience with two specialists, but different success rates with them, identify the altruism parameter.
\medskip

\item Strength of priors ($a_0 + b_0$):
how the marginal effect of the success rate changes with experience (i.e., interaction)
\[
\alpha m_{ijt} 
= \alpha \frac{ a_0 }{ (a_0 + b_0) + e_{ijt} } 
+ \alpha \frac{ e_{ijt} }{ (a_0 + b_0) + e_{ijt} } \times \bar y_{ijt}

\begin{frame}[t]{[UPDATE] Event study of specialist's first failure event}
{Effect on referrals per quarter from PCP observing the failure vs.~other PCPs}
\begin{itemize}

\item Within each specialist, compute the difference in referral rates between PCPs who did not observe first failure and PCP who did:
\bit
    \item Define: $I_j$ = PCPs who ever refer to specialist $j$; \\
    $F_j$ = PCP who observes first failure (at time $t_j^1$); 
    and $C_j = I_j \setminus F_j$ 
    \item Compute referral rates from $C_j$ and $F_j$ to $j$ in each quarter: $\bar d^C_{jt}$, $\bar d^F_{jt}$
    \item Take the difference in each quarter, up to the time when the specialist has a second failure: $\bar d^F_{jt} - \bar d^C_{jt}$, \ $t = t_j^0 \dots (t_j^2 - 1$)
    \item Compute the average difference across specialists, using quarters relative to first failure ($q = t - t^1_j$)
\eit
\medskip \pause

\item Corresponds to the following panel model:
\vskip-6pt
$$D_{ijt} = \alpha_{jt} I_{ij} + \gamma F_{ij} + \sum_{q = -9}^{Q_j} \beta_q F_{ij} 1(t - t_j^1 = q) + U_{ijt}$$

\small 

where $I_{ij} = 1(i \in I_j)$ and $F_{ij} = 1(i \in F_j)$
\medskip

($D_{ijt}$ here reflects both the arrival of a patient to PCP $i$ and the decision to refer that patient to specialist $j$)

Baseline mean of dependent variable = 0.187 (treated group before failure)

\iffalse
Sample restricted to PCP/specialist pairs where the specialist ever has a failure (for any PCP).
Balanced panel with xxx quarterly observations.
The treated group is the PCP that sent the patient with the failure and the control group is all other PCPs that also sent patients to that specialist.
\fi
% OLD: When focusing on the first failure in terms of timing, we have 178,903 observations with a mean dependent variable of 0.096 patients per pair per quarter (again, lots of zeros!). When focusing on the second failure, we have 135,188 observations with a mean dependent variable of 0.090. When we stack the first four failure events, we have 466,730 observations with a mean dependent variable of 0.097.
